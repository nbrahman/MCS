##Record Manager
The Record Manager handles tables with a fixed schema. Clients can insert records, delete records, update records, and scan through the records in a table. A scan is associated with a search condition and only returns records that match the search condition. Each table should be stored in a separate page file and Record Manager accesses the pages of the file through the Buffer Manager implemented in the earlier assignment.
